The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. This makes it relative to the viewport height.

It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh.

body{
  width:100%;
  height:100vh;
}

The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.

As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other.

label{
  display:block;
  margin:0.5rem 0;
}

<fieldset>
        <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input /></label>
        <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input /></label>
        <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input /></label>
        <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input /></label>
      </fieldset>
